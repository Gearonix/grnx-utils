<h3></h3>

Collection of `types` and `interfaces` for your project. You don't have to download libraries like [utility-types](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types) or copy your types from project to project.

The package provides the usual types like `Nullable<T>`, but also adds types for `react` and preact.
## Installation

```
yarn add @grnx-utils/types -D
```


> **Info**
> To use `react` or `preact` types, 
> you must have the appropriate dependencies installed.
